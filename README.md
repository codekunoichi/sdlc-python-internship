# Introduction
Welcome to an 8-week internship focused on developing fundamental skills for internships. Throughout this program, you will learn the art of building basic internal tools using Python, master the art of REST API debugging using the powerful tool Postman, and enjoy the guidance of our AI-powered tutor, ChatGPT, as your trusted companion throughout this incredible journey!

My name is [Rumpa Giri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rgiri/), and I'm excited to be your mentor for an exciting internal tools project! Together, we'll dive into the world of Python, Rest APIs, and using cool tools like Postman, Chat GPT, and GitHub CoPilot. With our collaboration, we'll quickly bring your ideas to life through coding and help propel our internal project to new milestones. Let's embark on this fun and rewarding coding adventure together!

2. Python Basics (30 minutes):
   - Variables, data types, and type conversion.
   - Operators and expressions.
   - Control flow statements (if-else, loops).
   - Functions and parameter passing.

3. Data Structures (30 minutes):
   - Lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
   - Accessing and manipulating data structures.

7. Testing and Debugging (15 minutes):
   - Importance of testing in software development.
   - Overview of testing frameworks (e.g., unittest).
   - Debugging techniques and tools.

8. Additional Resources and Best Practices (15 minutes):
   - Provide recommended resources for further learning (books, websites, online courses, etc.).
   - Discuss best practices for writing clean and maintainable Python code.
   - Encourage participation in the developer community (forums, meetups, conferences).

Conclusion:
- Your journey to career success is fueled by your effort and engagement. As you embark on this early stage of your career, embrace the mindset of continuous learning and experimentation. Dive deep into the craft of software development, with a focus on test-driven development and clean, elegant design. Stay humble in the face of challenges, and let your curiosity keep you hungry for knowledge. Remember, the more you immerse yourself in the world of coding, the more doors of opportunity will open for you. Embrace the adventure and enjoy the thrill of constant growth!
- We highly encourage asking questions and seeking clarification when needed. There no silly questions, only silly answers!

# Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude and acknowledge the following individuals for their invaluable contributions to the curation of this repository:

Dr. Srinjoy Das (LinkedIn: [Dr. Srinjoy Das](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinjoy-das-2073301/)): I extend my heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Das for generously sharing the content of the python course taught at WVU DS 101. Their expertise has played a significant role in shaping the materials presented here.

[A byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/): Based on Dr. Das' suggestion, this remarkable book has served as a fundamental resource for curating the Jupyter Notebook content. Its insights and guidance have been instrumental in creating a comprehensive learning experience.

I would like to acknowledge ChatGPT for its invaluable assistance in curating portions of the content found in this repository. English is not my native language, but with the aid of ChatGPT, many of the blurbs you encounter here, including this acknowledgement section, have been refined from my initial draft outline. In a paragraph where I expressed my intent, ChatGPT greatly improved the grammar and transformed it into content worthy of a blog!

I would also like to express my deepest gratitude to the countless generous souls who have written exceptional READMEs on GitHub repositories, provided sample repositories, and authored numerous O'Reilly books. Their selfless contributions have been instrumental in shaping the development and understanding of this repository.

I am truly grateful for the collective efforts of these individuals, as their expertise and generosity have made this repository possible.
