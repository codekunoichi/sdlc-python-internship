# Local Development Setup

## Setup GitHub CodeSpaces to do local development
- Without the hassle of local setup, you can get a devlopment environment interacting with your repository.
- Read more about CodeSpaces [here](https://github.com/codespaces)
- 1 min tutorial to get setup see this [video](https://youtu.be/_W9B7qc9lVc)
- Note - As of Jan 2023 I read there is 15GB and 120 Core Hours of Free Use per month on personal account. Please review [here](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts)
- If you have a day job and can only spend daily 30 mins on weekdays and 4 to 5 hours per weekend, the hours cover more than enough for self learning pace.(It will be less than 50 hours per month of use, hence the conclusion.)

## GitHub Basics

Learn more about Git Basics [here](https://github.com/education/github-starter-course)

Configure Git:
- Set the name: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
- Set the email: `git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"`

The following commands are your daily bread and butter, if you are using CLI

1. `git status -s` To check the latest status of your local repository compared to the destination
2. `git add TBD_FILE_NAME` adds a specific file to the staging area, replace TBD_FILE_NAME with the name of the file.
3. `git commit -m "my changes"` Always be in a habit to provide good commit messages, any body can write code, always write more to serve the reader later on. You save time for others being thoughtful about your code commit comments.
4. `git add -all` Adds all the files to the staging area, that have uncommitted changes.
5. `git commit -am "commit message"` combines the add to staging area and commit with the commit message.
6. `git push origin master` or `git push origin main` push the committed changes to the main or master branch. 


## Add GitHub CoPilot Extension

## Postman
1. Go to [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and get the latest postman tool.
2. Create an account in postman, I created one using my gmail account. This helps create your own workspace and fork interesting Postman Collection to work in your workspace.
3. [Public REST APIs](https://www.postman.com/cs-demo/workspace/public-rest-apis/collection/8854915-454a2dc7-dcbe-41cf-9bfa-da544fcd93a2) Is a colleciton of random publicly available REST APIs, which you can play with in your postman tool and study the underlying HTTP request/response.
4. The best tool for debugging APIs in general, is to call it using API Exploration tool like Postman and play with query parameters and study the HTTP Response in real-time to debug pressing issues. 
5. Most likely, the REST APIs you would be using is secured by an API Token, understand the authorization mechanism for the REST API you will be working for before tinkering around with the API in Postman.

## ChatGPT
1. Create an account in ChatGPT if you have not go to [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup?launch)
2. Take this course to learn [effective prompt engineering](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/), before embarking on partnering with ChatGPT.
3. The course teaches you how to give clear and specific instructions to ChatGPT to get your help better and faster.
- Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
- Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
4. You are the ultimate owner of your work, even if you seek assistance from ChatGPT. Therefore, it is crucial to diligently verify the output generated by ChatGPT, ensuring that it aligns with your original intention. It is important not to attribute mistakes solely to ChatGPT, but rather to take full accountability for consciously utilizing ChatGPT as a means to enhance your productivity. Embrace the tool like ChatGPT to boost your efficiency, but remember to take complete ownership of the outcomes it produces. (Embrace Extreme Ownership!).
5. Under no circumstances should proprietary information be entered into ChatGPT. It is imperative to maintain a level of informality and abstraction in your inquiries if you seek to deepen your understanding. For instance, refrain from pasting SQL queries or fragments of code from your company and asking for fixes. Instead, delve into your own curiosity by focusing on what you don't know and formulating abstract questions. For example, let's say you are well-versed in PostgreSQL syntax but unfamiliar with MSSQL syntax, yet you have a clear understanding of what you need for your next discovery. In such cases, you can provide a query similar to the one below for reference:

See image below:

By adhering to these guidelines, you can explore and learn more effectively while safeguarding proprietary information.

7. Lastly, if you are curious and tenacious, ChatGPT is an unending source of information, that never gets tired, so keep your curiosity and hunger of experimentation high!

Lets get started!!
