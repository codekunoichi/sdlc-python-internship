# Local Development Setup

## Setup GitHub CodeSpaces to do local development
- Without the hassle of local setup, you can get a devlopment environment interacting with your repository.
- Read more about CodeSpaces [here](https://github.com/codespaces)
- 1 min tutorial to get setup see this [video](https://youtu.be/_W9B7qc9lVc)
- Note - As of Jan 2023 I read there is 15GB and 120 Core Hours of Free Use per month on personal account. Please review [here](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts)
- If you have a day job and can only spend daily 30 mins on weekdays and 4 to 5 hours per weekend, the hours cover more than enough for self learning pace.(It will be less than 50 hours per month of use, hence the conclusion.)

Configure Git:
- Set the name: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
- Set the email: `git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"`

The following commands are your daily bread and butter, if you are using CLI

1. `git status -s` To check the latest status of your local repository compared to the destination
2. `git add TBD_FILE_NAME` adds a specific file to the staging area, replace TBD_FILE_NAME with the name of the file.
3. `git commit -m "my changes"` Always be in a habit to provide good commit messages, any body can write code, always write more to serve the reader later on. You save time for others being thoughtful about your code commit comments.
4. `git add -all` Adds all the files to the staging area, that have uncommitted changes.
5. `git commit -am "commit message"` combines the add to staging area and commit with the commit message.
6. `git push origin master` or `git push origin main` push the committed changes to the main or master branch.
