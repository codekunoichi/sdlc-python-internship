[WORK HABIT TIPS FROM A SENIOR GOOGLE SOFTWARE ENGINEER!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7vZWvSqYMQ&t=2191s) This is a timeless wisdom for budding software engineers, from [Dr. Robert Gardner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-gardner-phd/) - my first ever boss, from whom I learnt to be the engineer who I am today.

1. 8 min - Just Deliver, Ignore distractions
2. 10 Min - Plan before implement
3. 12 Min - Identify Unknown - do the hard stuff first.
4. 15 Min - Programming Approach - Top Down vs. Bottom Up. (I am a bottom up person, starts with the data model and upwards, your style may be different, there is no one way of doing thing, find your way you feel most comfortable with.)
5. 17 min - Development Approach - Depth First vs Breadth First (Breadth first is recommended, again, this ia very personal preference, breadth first helps you wrap your head and align with big picture sooner than later.)
6. 20 Min - Develop features end to end.
7. 23 Min - Time management, timed break.
8. 24 Min - Always learn, never get yourself outdated.
9. 31 Min - Asking for help. Welcome ChatGPT as your tutor for anything you are curious about!
10.35 Min - Work Life Balance or Work Life Harmony!


[Randy Pausch Last Lecture: Achieving Your Childhood Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo&t=4s)
Carnegie Mellon Professor [Randy Paush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Pausch) (Oct. 23, 1960 - July 25, 2008) gave his last lecture at the university Sept. 18, 2007, before a packed McConomy Auditorium. In his moving presentation, "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams," Pausch talked about his lessons learned and gave advice to students on how to achieve their own career and personal goals. 

Timeless Wisdom… some of my takeaways

- It’s all about the fundamentals. (That is why Algorithms, RDBMS Concepts, SQL is so important to me)
- Be good at something. Work hard. Be prepared.
- Have specific dreams. Never lose the child-like Wonder.
- Brick walls are there for a reason.
- When you don’t get what you want, you get experience.
- It’s not what you say, but how you say it.
- Get somebody to be reflective.
- Get a feedback loop and listen to it.
- Show gratitude.
- Find the best in everybody.
- Always have fun!
- Don’t complain. Just work harder.
- When Nobody’s Saying Anything to You Anymore, That Means They Gave Up.
- Leadership Skills from Captain Kirk.
- If you lead your life the right way, your dreams will come to you.

# Courses

## Algorithms

https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1

https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1#syllabus
Foundational course for a application and software developer. Its good to know the under the hood of high level abstraction, how these abstractions come into being.

## Relational Database Management Systems

https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-management

https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-management#syllabus

*Note of caution* - Use relational databases only if it applies, plenty of document database present, know the usecase before picking type of database.

Foundational course for a application and software developer.

No amount of TDD can save a bad data model, so we MUST begin with the foundation of good data model design. Appreciate the power of how much database can do, instead of re-inventing the wheel.
You can reduce your TDD footprint, if you can rely on relational database constraints to model the real world constraints.
Whether you build application using Ruby, Go, PHP, Python etc domain data modelling principles are independent. Choice of programming language should never influence how the data is modeled.

## SQL Basics
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/learn-sql-basics-data-science?

https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science#syllabus

https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql

https://www.kaggle.com/learn/advanced-sql

This is an evergreen language to learn, this technology is older that we are and has passed the test of time. Irrespective of passing fad of a programming language, this  knowledge makes you invincible in creating long lasting applications. 

Understand set theory well, and you can unserstand how powerful the 5 keyword(select, from, where, order by, group by) SQL syntax is! There is lot more in SQL beyond these 5, but mastering these 5 key words and its principle helps to do better data mining.

## Building Dynamic Websites

[CS75 (Summer 2012) Lecture 9 Scalability Harvard Web Development David Malan](http://cs75.tv/2012/summer/) 

Ignore the PHP part, but it helps you understand the Web better and under the hood to help you make sense of the SaaS Applications we build and how the web/internet itself influences our design decisions.

Fundamental/Foundational Course - Must watch. Worth binge watching while folding clothes :slight_smile:
